#SVENwithVex

A potential design for the mini-SVEN that I thought of is one similar to the robot the team I was on designed for the 2015-2016 challenge Bank Shot. This robot had a shooter style contraption that helped get the collected balls into the scoring basket. What I was thinking we do is take this design and make it bigger so people can see it and not accidentially trip over it even though the robot used and that was built was pushing the boundaries on the size requirements for the robots already, and so that we could get small items to people who can't make it to SVEN. Like a quarter machine in the front of grocery stores people could give mini-SVEN a quarter and mini-SVEN could toss out a mystery item.
