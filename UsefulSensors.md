# SVENwithVEX

For the most part programs for Vex and or VexIQ robots is used for movement (robot move forward, robot turn right, ect.). If we have a mini-SVEN drawing people in or if we want sven to move we'll need sensors. 

One sensor that I can think of needing is a Gyro sensor. It can tell how far a robot turned. A potential problem that might happen in first running mini-SVEN is setting up to start the path the robot goes on. In the lead up to the VexIQ competitions that I participated in, it was always stressed that we put the robot in the exact same start position every time or else we wouldn't get the same results or we'd end up programming a wrong move into the robot. Other sensors that could potentially be useful are Bump switches, Touch sensors, and light/color sensors. A Bump switch could be used to make mini-SVEN like a roomba, run into something make the robot stop and wait for a while and try to get around the object. This might take a while to program and get working. Another use for a Touch sensor or Bump switch could just simply be to start the program. Finaly we come to a light or color sensor. This could be the easiest way to make the robot run but could end up bad too. Simply make it follow a set path made out of tape and just let it run it's course until it runs out of battery. The only problems I can see with this is the tape coming up or having to replace it and people messing up the path in some way.
